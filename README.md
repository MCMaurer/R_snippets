# R_snippets

A nice little repo for various snippets of useful R patterns that make me go "ooh that's nice, I should remember that". I've been running R help sessions for years now, and constantly find myself solving small problems that I want to remember. I also find myself thinking "ah I remember doing something like this in project X" and digging through scripts in that project. I'm trying to help myself out by taking 10 minutes to strip these useful snippets down to a minimal example using a built-in dataset if possible.

Structure:

- loosely organized into folders, with hopefully-useful filenames
- when possible, trying to use built-in datasets
- minimal dependencies for each snippet
- purpose in a description section, then light on comments throughout the actual code
- small, modular examples of patterns rather than start-to-finish examples or tutorials

**note**: see `example_data/generating_storms_data.R` to create some of the example data used in the `data_import/` examples.
