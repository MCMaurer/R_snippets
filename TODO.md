# ToDo List

- look through Fish_Models projects for some key examples
- give Notes_Workshops_Learning a deeper look for good snippets
- flesh out `tidybayes` examples
- do a bunch of examples with `across`, `map`, etc. just all the powerful `tidyverse` stuff that I usually do from scratch each time
- maybe a little tidyeval section?
